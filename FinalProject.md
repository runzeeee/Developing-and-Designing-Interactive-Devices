## Final Project Write-up And Documentation Link: https://www.notion.so/Whack-a-Mole-9a7a0d697a254b23b52a1e505a3ad66f

Using the tools and techniques you learned in this class, design, prototype and test an interactive device.

Project plan - November 22

Peer feedback on Project plans: November 24

Functional check-off - November 30 & December 2

Final Project Presentations - December 7

Write-up and documentation due - December 13

## Objective

The goal of this final project is for you to have a fully functioning and well-designed interactive device of your own design.
 
## Description

## Darchery
Scaled down version of archery where the players throw darts at an archery target, and the points for each player are tracked and displayed on a web server. The settings could be configured such that numerous games could be played.

## Deliverables

1. Project plan: Big idea, timeline, parts needed, fall-back plan.

## Big idea:

## Darchery
Scaled down version of archery where the players throw darts at an archery target, and the points for each player are tracked and displayed on a web server. The settings could be configured such that numerous games could be played.

## timeline:

November 7-10

Test out mini model of "Darchery"

November 10-14

Gather materials needed for bigger version of "Darchery"

November 15-18

Build the actual version of "Darchery"

November 21-22/23

Team's functional check off

November 28-December 2

Prepare the documentation / presentation


## parts needed:

Raspberry Pi 

Capacitor sensors

Joystick sensor

Digital screen

Alligator clips

Cardboards

Tapes

Tin foil

...



## fall-back plan:

whack-a-mole or mini golf


2. Functioning project: The finished project should be a device, system, interface, etc. that people can interact with.

3. Documentation of design process
4. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)
5. Video of someone using your project
6. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)

7. Group work distribution questionnaire

## Change of Design

It is fine to change your project goals, but please resubmit the project plan for the new design when you do that.


## Teams

You can and are not required to work in teams. Be clear in documentation who contributed what. The total project contributions should reflect the number of people on the project.

## Examples

[Here is a list of good final projects from previous classes.](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/wiki/Previous-Final-Projects)
This version of the class is very different, but it may be useful to see these.
